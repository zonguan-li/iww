Hello interviewers! My name is Deng Chuwei.I am an undergraduate student majoring in Business Administration at Guangdong Polytechnic Normal University.I am very glad to attend the interview for the Overseas Influencer Marketing Intern position. First, I believe my internship experience is well-matched with this role. I have three relevant internships in operations. At Xinguodu Group, I worked as a platform operator, mainly responsible for the operation and maintenance of the company’s Lichong shared power banks and Lishua electronic signature devices. During my internship at Kingsoft Xishanju, I was mainly in charge of material management for the game The Legend of Swordman Zero. From these internships, I have gained three key skills that fit this position: First, communication and coordination skills. At Kingsoft, I coordinated with different departments on more than 50 materials and ensured on-time delivery. Second, information research and planning skills. At Xinguodu, I researched campaigns from 5 competing power bank brands and designed a coupon promotion for our own product. Within one week after launch, the coupon usage rate reached 25%. Third, data analysis skills. I am proficient in SQL and Excel, and I have passed the National Computer Rank Examination Level 2, with practical experience in data work. Besides my experience and skills, I am also a self-media blogger with good English reading and writing abilities. I believe my personal strengths will support my long-term development in overseas influencer marketing. At the same time, I know that iFLYTEK is a company with strong strength and a leading position in the artificial intelligence industry. I would be very grateful if I could have the opportunity to join your team.
